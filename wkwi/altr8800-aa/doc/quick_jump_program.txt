Try uploading it by hand, possibly one line at a time
using mouse paste or Ctrl v .. whatever works if
anything works. ;)

Locally, Ctrl + C copies and using the browser's menu system to
paste allowed this mechanism to upload a working program to
this simulation!

One line at a time .. from the above .HEX dump of an assembler
program, that is. ;)

It's a lower case 'h' to create these out of memory held
in the simulation.

It's the upper case 'H' to then upload them back into the sim.

Note that this is two layers of simulation; here the discussion
is about the deeper sim (the one that would still be present
if the program were running on real hardware instead of on wokwi).

END.
