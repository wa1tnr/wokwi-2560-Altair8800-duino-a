Note: referring to 303o (oxc3) as 'JMP' here .. Altair 8800 manual calls it this.

Notation: line numbers (which are addresses, like a code dump)
are in Octal (base 8) and so are the instructions and operands.

For clean presentation the subscripted 'o' is omitted for the
addresses.

Notation used is provisional (no previous experience adding
notational marks to Octal code listings).


First program (27 May 2022)

Two Jumps:

000: 000o NOP  ; RESET to 000o for convenience only
001: 000o
002: 000o
003: 303o JMP
004: 033o 033o
005: 000o
don't care
033: 000o NOP
034: 000o
035: 000o
036: 303o JMP
037: 000o
040: 000o
don't care

end

Single-Stepped:

 all address switches to zero (down) and actuate EXAMINE.

 Iterate SINGLE_STEP (second switch from the left, of
 the bank of eight function switches).

  STEP  ADDR  VAL
    00  000: 000o  ; only use of EXAMINE switch (to get to step zero)
    01  001: 000o  ; first use of SINGLE_STEP switch (to get to step one)
    02  002: 000o
    03  003: 303o
    04  004: 033o
    05  005: 000o
    06  033: 000o
    07  034: 000o
    08  035: 000o
    09  036: 303o
    10  037: 000o  (first five address bit LED's all lit, here)
    11  040: 000o  (only A5 LED is now lit)
    12  000: 000o  (all address and LEDs now dark!)

So that's a nice visual cue at the very end of the program;
just that one high bit is set.  The thirteenth use of the
SingleStep switch brings the program back to the origin
(address zero).

Navigation by the (wall) clock (modulo 12)

The program was written to correlate each step to
the hour hand of an analog wall clock (or wrist
watch face).

Just for fun .. and to make tracking progress 'easy' ;)

  OCLOCK ADRS DATA
  12 pm: 000: 000o
   1 pm: 000: 000o
   2 pm: 000: 000o
   3 pm: 003: 303o JMP
   4 pm: 004: 033o to 033o
   5 pm: 005: 000o    MSB of zero
   6 pm: 033: 000o
   7 pm: 034: 000o
   8 pm: 035: 000o
   9 pm: 036: 303o JMP
  10 pm: 037: 000o to 000o (back to origin)
  11 pm: 040: 000o    MSB of zero - only A5 is lit

  12 am: 000: 000o RESET state - same as last '12 pm' seen.


The switches are laid out the same as the Altair 8800 Duino kit build;
you set the function switches to the preferred position (up, down) and
only then toggle the switch just below it (which completes the ground
so that the connected Arduino Due (simulated here) port pin will sense
it's been grounded.

The address/data switches do not require this, but on the Altair 8800
(Duino) most (or all?) the function switches (bottom row) are spring-
loaded SPDT switches with a center OFF position (both circuits open).

The best that could be done on Wokwi was to use a slide switch, leaving
returning the 'center OFF' position (lower switch) up to the operator
(you!) to perform, quite manually.

It's what we got, right now.

END.
