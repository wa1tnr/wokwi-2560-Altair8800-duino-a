Note: referring to 303o (oxc3) as 'JMP' here .. Altair 8800 manual calls it this.

Notation: line numbers (which are addresses, like a code dump)
are in Octal (base 8) and so are the instructions and operands.

For clean presentation the subscripted 'o' is omitted for the
addresses.

Notation used is provisional (no previous experience adding
notational marks to Octal code listings).


First program (27 May 2022)

Two Jumps:

001: 000o NOP
002: 000o
003: 303o JMP
004: 033o 033o
005: 000o
don't care
033: 000o NOP
034: 000o
035: 000o
036: 303o JMP
037: 000o
040: 000o
don't care

The switches are laid out the same as the Altair 8800 Duino kit build;
you set the function switches to the preferred position (up, down) and
only then toggle the switch just below it (which completes the ground
so that the connected Arduino Due (simulated here) port pin will sense
it's been grounded.

The address/data switches do not require this, but on the Altair 8800
(Duino) most (or all?) the function switches (bottom row) are spring-
loaded SPDT switches with a center OFF position (both circuits open).

The best that could be done on Wokwi was to use a slide switch, leaving
returning the 'center OFF' position (lower switch) up to the operator
(you!) to perform, quite manually.

It's what we got, right now.

END.
